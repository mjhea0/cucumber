# cucumber? what is this?

Good question. This is a basic Rails skelleton designed for test driven development, which uses:

- *Devise* for user management
- *RSpec* for unit testing 
- *Cucumber* for integration testing

Unit tests ensure that portions of code continue to work as you develop new features and refactor existing code. Meanwhile, integration tests are usually developed around "user stories" or "user behavior" for testing features from the end user's perspective.

Nice and crisp.
